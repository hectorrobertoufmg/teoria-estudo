## Reshaping Matrices in MATLAB

### Using the `reshape` Function
You can use the `reshape` function to reshape an m-by-n matrix into a p-by-q matrix, as long as the total number of elements remains the same:
```matlab
B = reshape(A, p, q)
```

### Convenience with Automatic Dimension Calculation
For convenience, leave one of the dimensions blank using `[]`, and it will be calculated automatically:
```matlab
B = reshape(A, [], q)
```

### Reshaping with the Colon Operator
Reshaping arrays is also possible using the colon operator `(:)`:
```matlab
x(:)
```

### Column-Major Format in MATLAB
It's not necessary to specify the order in which the elements of A are extracted because MATLAB stores data in a column-major format. For example:
```matlab
M = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
reshape(M, 3, 2)
```
The matrix M is stored in memory as 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6. The reshaped array is populated in the same order along each column.

### Extracting Elements Row-Wise
To extract elements row-wise, use the transpose operator (`'`) to transpose the matrix before reshaping:
```matlab
reshape(M', 3, 2)
```

### Task: Reshaping a Matrix
To reshape any matrix into a column vector, use the colon operator:
```matlab
x(:)
```

Feel free to adjust the formatting as needed.
